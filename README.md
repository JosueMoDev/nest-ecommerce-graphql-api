# üõí E-commerce - Nest and GraphQL

This is a backend system for an e-commerce platform built as a monorepo using NestJS. The current setup includes an **Admin Module** with features such as:

- **Product Management**: Create, update, and delete products.
- **Image Upload**: Upload product images to AWS S3.

In the future, we plan to transition to a microservices architecture. The Admin Module will be part of this architecture, while additional microservices will handle sales and other functionalities:

- **Sales Microservice**: To be developed with Golang and Gin for managing sales and orders.
- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ will be used for communication between microservices.

This setup ensures a scalable and maintainable system, with clear separation of concerns between different modules and services.
